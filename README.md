# PC Scores

The aim of these notebooks is to provide code and depth into some of the examples found in: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11665">Discovering latent topology and geometry in data: a law of large dimension</a>. Any references in the notebook to theorems, assumptions, etc. can be found there. 

Roughly, the notebooks look at the following sections of the paper: 

<ul>
  <li><b>pca_vs_pca+tsne</b></li>: the two examples in the introduction -- comparing the results of using PCA (car image example) and using PCA followed by t-SNE (newsgroup example). 
  <li><b>exploring_discrete_Z</b></li>: section 5.2 -- in this situation the Latent Metric Space model is a form of finite mixture model and the effect of n and p on the convergence of PC scores is considered. 
  <li><b>topology_geometric_relationships</b></li>: section 5.4-5.5 -- discovering structure of the latent domain through TDA techniques and nonlinear dimension reduction.
  <li><b>regression_classification</b></li>: section 5.7 -- illustrates using PCA as a pre-processing step before nearest neighbour regression/classification on two real-data examples.
</ul>
